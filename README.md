âœ… Testing Steps
To confirm PDFs are fetched and downloadable:

Run the project:

npm install
npm run dev


Check API response: Open http://localhost:3000/api//api/email-ingestion in a browser or Postman to verify that email data is fetched successfully.
Check UI: Open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser and ensure emails with PDF attachments are displayed.
The pdfs folder would be generated and the pdf will save when the api is called
